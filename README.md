A minimal implementation of an AI agent loop using OpenAI's tool calling API.
Built from first principles as a learning exercise - no frameworks like LangChain.

The agent can solve multi-step math problems by autonomously choosing and 
executing calculation tools (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
